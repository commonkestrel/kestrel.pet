Listen, I like trains.
Not as much as some, but probably a bit more than the average college student.
Recently, I've taken a large interest in the EMD AEM-7 locomotives,
despite never having seen one in person.
I live on the west coast, after all!

- 929 is still painted in its Amtrak Phase V livery, and is being used for parts.
- 938 has been repainted with a *beautiful* Caltrain livery
- 938 is attached to a single passenger car labeled **Caltrain PTC Safety Test Train**.
- 929 and 938 were both refurbished into AEM-7AC's within a month of each other, in 2001.
